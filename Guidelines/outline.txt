I want to create a local application using python for the following usecase: I am creating this time tracker app which is installed on a laptop. It should have following features. It should authenticate a user, so an authenticate page. Then it should show user the projects and tasks assigned to him, for that i ll give the apis to call, so keep the apis as dummy for now. Then he selects a task and then a timer starts and at interval of 10 mins, screenshots are taken and sent to an API i ll provide again, also another API for timeTracking at this point. The user can pause the timer when he pleases. When he pauses the timer, then there is no screenshot + timer info sent to the API. When he pauses the timer, he can switch the task and project. SO we need to pbuild all these UI for a local application. Also, we need to send the information of whether the laptop's scrrenshot permission is allowed or not to the API.
